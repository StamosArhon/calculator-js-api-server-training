# calculator-js-api-server-training
A simple calculator running on js. The calculator has a frontend UI and sends the user-input to a backend to do the calculation and return the result to output on the UI. This is a project specifically aimed to help me further improve my JavasScript/HTML/CSS skills, while also learning hot to setup a simple backend and utilize APIs.
